They also address the proper way to behave during the early stages of dating and when to post to social media… daddies… we gotta reel it back in. Lastly, men with little dicks need to stop lusting after women with fat asses AND yes, we are giving hand jobs again. Thank you! </p>

				<p>WE ARE BACK. Get ready for a very different episode this week. The girls have decided to do Call Her Daddy a little different this year starting with a HUGE announcement from Sofia and a deeply personal account from Alex. The Fathers have feelings!? Don't worry, they are still just as unwell. This week's episode addresses the topic of 'first impressions' with your significant other's friends and family and how to handle it. The girls roast the women who try too hard to be “one of the guys”, and last but not least, some hot girl-on-girl talk. Cheers to 2020! </p>

            </title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[
				<p>This week's episode kicks off with a mental breakdown from Alex who went snooping at a guys house and saw something she shouldn't have. Risky business! Also, the girls discuss why they (and women everywhere) can't cum during sex and a revolutionary way to take an a** pic. Ladies, this will be the only nude you will want to take from now on, GUARANTEED. Plus, the girls debate if it's ever okay to send a dirty video.…that includes you having sex with someone else. Hot? Or not? </p>

                <p>This week's episode kicks off with a mental breakdown from Alex who went snooping
                    at a guys house and saw something she shouldn't have. Risky business! Also, the
                    girls discuss why they (and women everywhere) can't cum during sex and a
                    revolutionary way to take an a** pic. Ladies, this will be the only nude you
                    will want to take from now on, GUARANTEED. Plus, the girls debate if it's ever
                    okay to send a dirty video.…that includes you having sex with someone else. Hot?
                    Or not?

                <p>The girls get serious as they tell a chilling story that took place in Elizabeth,
                    New Jersey. One they will never forget involving an abandoned house, law
                    enforcement, and oh yeah, they've got it all on film (check out the CHD
                    Instagram). Also this week, Alex and Sofia discuss a sex tip so scary they've
                    only seen it done in porn... until now. Introducing ‘Scream' and ‘The Joker'-
                    they tried it out for the daddies and are giving you all the details. Also men,
                    you should be having the poop talk with your girl. We are telling you how.

				<p>In this week's episode, Alex and Sofia are giving health and wellness a good ol' fashioned try. You heard that right! The girls discuss the importance of “having your own life” in a relationship and where so many women go wrong- especially WAGS, (wives and girlfriends of professional athletes). They also discuss the most cringe-y thing a guy can post on his dating profile (no thanks), clout chasing, and most importantly WALKS OF SHAME. Otherwise known as a stride of pride for a true daddy. Enjoy! </p>

                <p>In this weeks episode, the girls tell a story of an unexpected visitor who showed
                    up to their apartment…and shit got sexual. They also address what signs to look
                    out for if you think your partner is being shady. Cheat or be cheated on!

                    with your guy/girl in public group settings, and some hacks that could RUIN

                <![CDATA[
				<p>Alex and Sofia are talking datings apps and sliding into the DMs, specifically for girls who are not shooting their shot and absolutely need to be. They are also talking sex ‘sins,' where they cover the basics like foreplay, screaming and scratching but also include some you haven't thought of and are probably committing. You don't deserve to f*** if you are doing these!! Finally, the girls lose their shit while trying to explain the newest most underrated sex position. Not for the easily offended. P.S. girls need to stop crying about getting hit on. Knock. it. off. </p>

				<p>Alex and Sofia are getting into how to make your girl and/or guy jealous, especially out at the bar/in social settings. It's unhealthy but it works! They also discuss a little black (manipulative) book a guy left behind that got his d*** sucked, their embarrassing makeup moments- when a guy walks in on the foundation/eyebrow/contour phase, and a PSA from milf hunter on how he likes girls to ride it on top. Lastly, they finally begin to touch on Professional Athletes with a personal testimonial from Alex, a side bitch, and a cum rag. Enjoy. </p>

                <p>The girls are here to discuss how to get over a breakup and introduce one of the
                    riskiest games of poker ever played…condom poker. Watch out for STD's! They also
                    get into the ‘double tap' feature on the iPhone and how you can use it to become
                    a master manipulator. Last but definitely not least, the girls bring us a new
                    sex tip to make sure your sex is hot and steamy and it involves flipping the
                    bird.
