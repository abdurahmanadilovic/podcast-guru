                In 2016 a young girl went missing from her home in the middle of the night. It would

            <title>INFAMOUS: The Dexter Killer</title>
            <description>
                In October 2008, Johnny Altinger headed out to meet up for the first time with Jen,
                a woman he’d met on a popular online dating site. They had plans to meet at her
                place for a casual hook-up, and Johnny diligently followed the driving directions
                she’d emailed him earlier that day. But when he walked through the door of her
                detached garage in Edmonton, Alberta, it wasn’t love he found but something much
                more sinister. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character

                A young Chicago girl's brutal murder in 1946 led police to a dangerous criminal with

            <description>
                In December 2017, a realtor touring the mansion of billionaires Barry and Honey
                Sherman made a gruesome discovery: the bodies of 75-year-old Barry and 70-year-old
                Honey semi-seated and hanging from the railing around their pool deck. Police
                believe the deaths were targeted, and many feel the motive was money. Who killed
                Barry and Honey Sherman? And why? Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due

            <title>CAPTURED: The Monster of Miramichi</title>
            <description>
                In 1989, Allan Legere was serving a life sentence for the murder of an elderly
                shopkeeper in a rural part of New Brunswick, Canada. Until he escaped. For seven
                months, he evaded capture, living in the woods around the Miramichi river, only
                coming out at night to steal food, rob houses, and murder the community’s most
                vulnerable citizens. More than 30 years later, people still remember the fear and
                panic that gripped a community, caused by one man - the Monster of the Miramichi.

            <description>
                In 1992 Lisa Ziegert felt like someone was watching her at a gift shop where she
                worked. People would tell her no one was there; it was just in her head. But when
                she goes missing from that very same gift shop everyone begins to wonder if Lisa had
                been right. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character

            <description>
                He was charming enough to win an episode of The Dating Game back in the 70's and
                that charm is what allowed Rodney Alcala to slip through police's fingers time and
                time again. Though his reign of terror lasted only a few years, he may be one of the
                most prolific serial killers of our time and police still need your help to identify
                some of his victims. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character

                When Navy sailor Kyle Antonacci was found dead in his barracks in 2010,
                investigators quickly ruled it a suicide. However, discrepancies pop up right away
                and his family is left with one critical question: did Kyle really die by suicide,
                or was it something more sinister? Sources for this episode cannot be listed here

            <description>
                For three weeks in October 2002, the nation's capital region was paralyzed with fear
                as a series of deadly sniper attacks killed innocent people across Washington D.C.,
                Maryland, and Virginia. This week, we partnered with the FBI to bring you this
                episode and to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the first African-American agent
                joining the Bureau. Together with a very special guest from the FBI, we delve into
                the case of the notorious DC Sniper. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here

                When Jennifer Levin is found murdered in Central Park in 1986, and one of her
                private school friends is arrested for the crime, it catalyzes bitter debates about
                sex, privilege, legal ethics, parental responsibility, socioeconomics, victim’s
                rights, and so much more, because before there was the OJ Simpson trial, there was

            <title>MISSING: Women of Vancouver’s downtown Eastside</title>
            <description>
                For two decades, women living in a ten-block stretch of Vancouver, British Columbia,
                Canada, were disappearing without a trace. This week’s episode is part one of a
                two-part series. It’s a story of tragedy and triumph – and of one man who terrorized
                the downtown Eastside for almost two decades. Sources for this episode cannot be
                listed here due to character limitations. For a full list of sources, please visit

            <description>
                In the early morning hours of June 3, 2011, Lauren Spierer went out and celebrated
                the end of a semester by partying with friends. It should have been like so many
                weekends before. But on this morning Lauren would leave the company of her friends
                and walk off alone in the direction of her apartment, never to be seen again.

                In 1996 a small Texas community was rocked by the tragic slaying of two young boys.

                The boy's mother. And they would work tirelessly to make sure she paid the price.

                In May of 2014, a married couple went to check in on their elderly neighbors, who
                lived alongside the scenic Lake Oconee. Inside the older couple's house, they would
                find one of the most gruesome crime scenes of all-time, which kicked off a
                terrifying mystery that remains unanswered today... Sources for this episode cannot

            <description>
                During spring break of 1975, Shelia & Kate Lyon went missing from a shopping center
                near their home and for almost 40 years no one knew what happened to them. Over the
                years horrible men would come into focus as suspects. Men who took the lives of
                10-year-old Amanda Ray, 5-year-old Neely Smith, and 15-year-old Kathy Beatty. But it
                wasn't until a cold case investigator came across a single old report from 1975 (a
                report that had been there all along) that the case would finally be solved and Mr.
                & Mrs. Lyon would finally have answers about what happened to their daughters.

                In 2006 Brandy Hall vanished after leaving her post at the volunteer fire station

            <title>INFAMOUS: Alice Crimmins</title>
            <description>
                Long before Casey Anthony, there was another mother America loved to hate... Alice
                Crimmins. When her children went missing from their room one summer night, the
                police and the press were quick to point the finger at the "sex-crazed" mother. At
                the start of the women's lib movement, Alice stood for everything that threatened
                the status quo of how a wife and mother should behave. But over 50 years later we
                can re-examine the case and her multiple trials to see if there really was a case
                against Alice or if she was the victim of a witch hunt. Sources for this episode

            <description>
                In August of 1976, the bodies of a young man and woman were found in rural Sumter
                County, South Carolina. Police would infer a lot from their belongings and the state
                of their bodies, but more than four decades later, their identities - as well as the
                identity of their killer - remain a mystery... BUT the Crime Junkies have a chance
                to change that. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character

            <description>
                On April 3, 2019 someone claiming Timmothy Pitzen approached a stranger in KY and
                told them he had escaped abductors. The news went wild with this information as the
                public waited for DNA results to come in. We learned that the man was not Timmothy
                but it reignited one of the most mysterious disappearance cases in IL history. On
                this episode of Crime Junkie, we will tell you about the day Timmothy left school
                with his mom in 2011 and the strange circumstances surrounding their whereabouts
                after. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

                Captain Kevin Smith of the Indiana State Police granted us an interview to discuss
                the arrest of April Tinsley's killer who was apprehended in July of 2018 using new
                genealogy methods. He tells us what it was like finally catching John Miller after
                30 years, how they decided to use this method to find him and what this new

            <description>
                In March of 1998 Amy Lynn Bradley and her family set off and what was to be the trip
                of a lifetime, a full week-long cruise around the Caribbean. But little did they
                know their dream vacation would turn into a nightmare when Amy goes missing from
                their stateroom in the early morning hours of March 24, 1998. Over 20 years have
                passed and clues of her fate are few and far between but there have been credible
                sightings to suggest that Amy is alive and being held captive. Sources for this

                family and investigators are left wondering if this was a terrible accident or foul
                play. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <description>
                Sneha Philip was last seen shopping just a couple blocks away from the World Trade
                Centers on September 11, 2001. She never returned home that night or after the
                attacks leaving many to speculate whether she died as a result of the terrorist
                attacks or if she saw the tragedy as an opportunity to walk away from her life and
                start over. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character

            <title>WANTED: Austin Yogurt Shop Killer</title>
            <description>
                In the early 90's, Austin, TX was turned upside down when four young girls were
                sexually assaulted, murdered, then set on fire inside an ICBY store. Four men were
                accused of the crime, but there have always been questions around their guilt. Those
                questions have only been amplified in recent years as new DNA technology as revealed
                an unknown perpetrator's DNA at the scene. Sources for this episode cannot be listed

            <description>
                This is probably the strangest case of murder we have ever covered here on Crime
                Junkie. It's the story of Robert Wone who, while staying in a friend's DC guest
                room, was brutally attacked. But with a staged crime scene, a timeline that doesn't
                add up, and three people keeping secrets we may never get to the bottom of what
                happened in the Swann Street house on August 2, 2006. Sources for this episode

            <title>SERIAL KILLER: Dr. No</title>
            <description>
                During the 80's and 90's, a serial killer was operating out of Ohio, killing sex
                workers and leaving their bodies along interstates. Could their killer be a truck
                driver who called himself Dr. No? And could his crimes extend beyond the Ohio state
                lines? Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>WANTED: Bradford Bishop // Yaser Said</title>
            <description>
                This week, we have two stories for you of men who are wanted for killing their
                families. Our first story is about a man named Bradford Bishop, a man who, after not
                receiving a promotion at work, went home, and methodically killed his entire family.
                Officials believe he then fled the country and has been living out his days in
                Europe. Our second story is about a man named Yaser Said who is still on the FBI's
                10 most wanted list for murdering his two daughters in the back of his cab. His
                daughter died while on the phone with 911 trying to get help, but they couldn't get
                to her in time. The FBI believe Yasser is now living in NYC and working as a cab
                driver. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MISSING: Asha Degree</title>
            <description>
                In February of 2000, a 9-year-old girl named Asha Degree packed her book bag and
                tucked it away, waiting for the right time to sneak out of her North Carolina home.
                To this day, no one knows why she left, or why she was walking along Highway 18
                alone around 4 in the morning. And the case would only get more confusing as her
                belongings start to pop up along that same highway, spaced out over 26 miles, and 18
                months. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <description>
                In 1986, park rangers near Virginia's Colonial Parkway get notified of a possible
                traffic accident. When rangers arrive, they are confronted with a violent scene. The
                deaths of Cathleen Thomas and Rebecca Dowski. Though it is brutal and seemingly
                unprovoked, the public doesn't start getting truly concerned until two more young
                people, Robin Edwards and David Knobling, are murdered just off the Parkway. Sources

            <title>MISSING: Alissa Turney</title>
            <description>
                In 2001 Mike Turney reported to Phoenix, Arizona police that his 17-year-old
                step-daughter, Alissa, had run away to California. But 7 years later, a serial
                killer comes forward with a story that would launch an investigation into her
                disappearance and make her family fear that Alissa had been a victim of foul play.

            <title>CONSPIRACY: Women in the U.S. Military</title>
            <description>
                In 2010, statistics came out that 120 female U.S. soldiers stationed in Iraq had
                died. Half of those deaths were reported to be non-combat related. 30 those
                non-combat related deaths were ruled suicides, but there is evidence to suggest many
                of them may have actually been murders. In this episode, we dive into the case of
                LaVena Johnson and other women of the U.S. military who died very suspicious deaths
                during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due

            <title>MISSING: Maura Murray (Part 2)</title>
            <description>
                This week we re-examine everything we thought we knew about Maura and her
                disappearance. Lying, stealing, cheating... all of this led Maura to leave her dorm
                room that February 9th. But the more we learn about Maura and her life the more
                questions we have about why she would have gone to New Hampshire and if she really
                traveling alone? Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character

            <title>MISSING: Maura Murray (Part 1)</title>
            <description>
                In 2004 a 21-year-old UMass student, Maura Murray, sends a message to her professors
                saying there has been a death in her family and she will be out for the next week.
                But that's a lie. No one can explain why Maura did this or her strange actions to
                follow but just hours after sending that email, Maura ends up crashing her car on a
                rural road in Haverhill, NH. She is seen and talked to by locals but in a 7-minute
                window, when everyone seems to look away, Maura vanishes. In this first episode, I
                will tell you what we all thought we knew about Maura and her disappearance early on
                in the investigation. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to

            <description>
                Sometime after dropping off her young daughter at the school bus, Angela Savage and
                her 6-month-old son were abducted. Angela's body would eventually be found on a dirt
                path near her home, having been assaulted, tied up and left with no shoes. Despite
                being a small community the case goes cold for almost 30 years until a strange
                incident connects Angela's murder to the death of another young girl and police are
                able to solve the case. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to

            <title>SERIAL KILLER: Bible John</title>
            <description>
                In the late 1960s, three women were murdered after attending the same nightclub. But
                aside from their location, all three women had something very specific in common.
                Was this thing they had in common the reason they were killed or was their killer, a
                man now known as Bible John, after them because they were frequenting a nightclub
                known for hookups and infidelity? It is now decades later and police are still
                looking for a red-haired man last seen with all three women. Sources for this

            <title>MURDERED: Danielle "Gabby" Akers</title>
            <description>
                In April of 2016, Danielle "Gabby" Akers's body was found in a creek bed 60 miles
                from her home. She had no clothes or personal belongings with her and its still

                When Terrance Williams goes missing, most law enforcement officers consider him a
                low-priority; He wanted, or needed, to disappear. But when his last known location
                is with Deputy Steven Calkins, suspicions are raised as to whether or not this is a
                random disappearance, or a plotted out crime. Sources for this episode cannot be

            <title>MURDERED: Barbara Nantais & Claire Hough</title>
            <description>
                In the dreamy summers of southern California, two murders happen within yards of
                each other, but a decade apart. Questions echo throughout these cases. Are they
                connected? Can DNA help solve these cases? Or does it just muddle the facts even
                more? Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MURDERED: Angela Mischelle Lawless</title>
            <description>
                In November 1992, Mischelle Lawless was found by passersbys deceased in her car with
                the headlights on and the vehicle still running. Police have spent decades trying to
                piece together what happened to Mischelle that night. Who would she have pulled over
                for? Where was she headed? And even though a man served 16 years for her murder the
                current sheriff is convinced they still have not captured Mishelle's killer and it
                could all be tied back to the man... or men... who initially found her car. Sources

            <description>
                Since 1993, women in Juarez, Mexico have been dying violent deaths. Is this the work
                of one killer or multiple? Also, why did the state police work so hard to convince
                the public that it was the work of a man who was incarcerated, while many of the
                murders were still being committed? Sources for this episode cannot be listed here

            <title>SERIAL KILLER: The Claremont Killer</title>
            <description>
                Since 1996, people in Claremont had been looking over their shoulders when they go
                out for a night on the town. Over the span of a few years, three girls were taken
                from the same place in nearly identical fashions. Many years later, those crimes
                would be connected to other attacks dating back to 1988. And somehow, in 2016, a man
                was arrested for these crimes... But we still don't know exactly how police got his
                name. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>MISSING: Sage Smith</title>
            <description>
                On November 20, 2012, Sage Smith left her home at 5:30 for a date. She was seen
                alone at 6:30 talking to someone on the phone and then possibly sighted one more
                time at 7:00 at a cafe, again alone. Her father and friends were advocates and
                attempted to investigate her disappearance on their own, but ended up in the same
                place where the police ended up. At a dead end. No one has seen her since and police
                are still looking to speak with the man she last communicated with that day. Sources

            <description>
                Sylvia was a happy, beautiful 16-year-old when her parents left her and her sister
                in the care of Gertrude Baniszewski while they went on the road for work. But,
                within a few short months, Sylvia was beaten, humiliated, and ultimately left to die
                from neglect and severe abuse, inflicted by not only Gertrude, but the Baniszewski
                children, and neighborhood kids as well. Sources for this episode cannot be listed

            <title>SERIAL KILLER: The Green River Killer</title>
            <description>
                Through the 80's & 90's, women in the state of Washington were turning up dead.
                First, along the Green River, then in other clusters throughout the state and even
                into Portland, Oregon. Not only had these women been murdered but their killer would
                re-visit their corpses and sexually assault them multiple times until their corpses
                were fully decomposed and consumed by maggots. A man named Gary Ridgeway had been
                pointed out by a number of witnesses as being the Green River Killer but police were
                unable to make an arrest until DNA connected him to four crime scenes in 2001 – two
                decades and at least 49 victims later. Sources for this episode cannot be listed

            <title>MISSING: Misty Copsey</title>
            <description>
                In September of 1992, a young teenager named Misty Copsey went missing after
                visiting the local fair in Puyallup, Washington with her best friend. Almost 26
                years have passed and all we have are a handful of suspicious suspects and a pair of
                jeans found at a site that could be linked to a serial killer. Plus, a rogue private
                citizen, whose efforts to try to solve the case have become an obsession, that might
                actually be distracting from the real investigation. Sources for this episode cannot

            <title>CAPTURED: Ashley Freeman and Lauria Bible's Killer</title>
            <description>
                In April of 2018, we were all talking about the capture of the Gold State Killer but
                did you know another long-time cold case was solved that same week? On December 29,
                1999, best friends Lauria Bible and Ashley Freeman were having a sleepover at
                Ashley's house. Sometime in the early morning hours of December 30th, Ashley's
                parents were murdered and their home set on fire. The two girls were never seen
                again. For years, theories surrounded this case. Did Someone take the girls? Were
                the girls responsible for one or more murders and then ran off to start new lives?
                Well in 2018 we finally got answers, though, as of this recording their remains have
                still not been found. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to

            <description>
                In 2011, Bethany Decker's life was far from easy. As a young wife and mother with a
                husband overseas in the military, things were strained. When her husband comes back
                for a short leave, Bethany shares some shocking news and then disappears, never to
                be seen again. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character

            <description>
                On April 25th, 2018, a decades-long search for the man believed to be the Visalia
                Ransacker, the East Area Rapist, the Original Night Stalker, and the Golden State
                Killer was identified and apprehended by authorities. We spoke with Criminology
                Podcast's Mike Morford, who took us through some of the most notable factors of the
                crimes and arrest, and what this means for cold cases everywhere. Source for this

            <description>
                19-year-old Kenia Monge went missing in downtown Denver on April 1, 2011. When
                Kenia's stepdad finds an eerie text message from a stranger on her phone, it leads
                him and police right to her killer. However, without Kenia's body and no clue where
                she might be the only thing they could do was wait for the man to strike again.

            <title>ADNAN: What Serial Didn't Tell You</title>
            <description>
                Hundreds of millions of people tuned into Serial season one back in 2014. Sarah
                Koenig told us all about the story of 18-year-old high school senior Hae Min Lee who
                disappeared on January 13th, 1999. Hae's body was later found in Leakin Park, and
                not too long after the discovery of her body, police zeroed in on their prime
                suspect: Adnan Syed. Sarah took us all through 12 episodes of "Did he or didn't he?"
                and many of us ended the season with more questions than answers. But did you know
                that Serial was just the beginning and there was so much that Sarah never covered?
                If you listened to Serial season one, you must listen to this single episode that
                sums up the top four points Serial didn't tell you, but you need to know before you
                decide whether or not you think Adnan is guilty. We won't be re-covering the Serial
                story - we jump in assuming you already know it. So, if you haven't listened yet,
                check out the first season of Serial. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here

<p>Hundreds of millions of people tuned into Serial season one back in 2014. Sarah Koenig told us all about the story of 18-year-old high school senior Hae Min Lee who disappeared on January 13th, 1999. Hae's body was later found in Leakin Park, and not too long after the discovery of her body, police zeroed in on their prime suspect: Adnan Syed. Sarah took us all through 12 episodes of "Did he or didn't he?" and many of us ended the season with more questions than answers. But did you know that Serial was just the beginning and there was so much that Sarah never covered? If you listened to Serial season one, you must listen to this single episode that sums up the top four points Serial didn't tell you, but you need to know before you decide whether or not you think Adnan is guilty. We won't be re-covering the Serial story - we jump in assuming you already know it. So, if you haven't listened yet, check out the first season of Serial.</p><p>Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.

            <title>WANTED: Monster in Fort Wayne, Indiana</title>
            <description>
                Thirty years ago this week, a little girl in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was abducted,
                sexually assaulted, murdered and now, forgotten by everyone. It is one of the most
                horrific crimes we've ever researched, and yet when we ask people if they know about
                April Tinsley, we only get blank stares. This man, who police believed was local,
                not only committed the crime, but taunted police and the community for 16 years
                after. He could still be walking among us - You could very well know him. Sources

            <title>MISSING: Kiplyn Davis</title>
            <description>
                In 1995, one of our listeners from Kentucky was high school pen pals with a girl
                named Kiplyn Davis from Spanish Fork, Utah, when one day the Spanish Fork Police
                called looking for answers. Kiplyn had gone missing. Kiplyn's story takes over 16
                years to unfold and even though a few young men have been accused of and pled guilty
                to murder, no one has ever found Kiplyn or her remains. Sources for this episode

            <title>MURDERED: The Longo Family</title>
            <description>
                What makes a seemingly normal family man snap, murder his entire family, and assume
                a new identity in Mexico? Christian Longo was a husband, and father of three kids,
                who moved his family to Oregon to escape legal and money trouble he had accrued back
                in Michigan. But the new start didn't take away the pressure of supporting a family
                on a part-time, minimum wage income. One December day, Christian's family is found
                in the most horrific ways and Christian is nowhere to be found. The prosecution and
                the public seem pretty clear on what took place the day the Longo family died, but
                Christian's surprise story after he goes to trial is just his final way of
                disgracing his family. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to

            <description>
                In December of 2015, Katelin was to board a plane from VA to AZ. She texted her mom
                that she made it to the airport and her phone was dying, so she would text later.
                But Katelin never made it on that flight and she has never been seen since. The
                investigation into her disappearance will make you question everything about
                Katelin's last day and by the end, you won't know who's account can be trusted.

            <title>CONSPIRACY: Bardstown, Kentucky</title>
            <description>
                A 35-year-old woman named Crystal Rogers went missing from Bardstown, KY back in
                2015\. Her car was found on the side of a busy parkway with a flat tire, keys,
                wallet, and phone still inside. Just 16 months later, while searching for answers,
                Crystal's father is murdered in cold blood. Now, people are wondering if these two
                crimes are connected to a bigger conspiracy that started with the murder of a police
                officer in 2013\. Could all of these seemingly different attacks be related? Sources

            <description>
                On May 17, 1968, a woman was found in the woods, murdered and wrapped in tent
                fabric. For over 30 years she remained unidentified in a Kentucky grave with a
                donated headstone that bore the name "Tent Girl". But 90s internet and a superhero
                named Todd come together to give this girl a name and give her family the answers
                they waited so many decades for. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due

            <title>WANTED: Killer on the High Bridge</title>
            <description>
                On February 13th, 2017, Abby Williams and Libby German went for a hike near the
                Monon High Bridge, in Delphi, Indiana. After Libby posted a Snapchat photo of Abby
                at 2:07 pm, the girls were never seen alive again. Searchers found their bodies near
                a creek parallel to the bridge less than 24 hours later on Valentine's Day. The
                investigation that has since ensued has left an entire nation searching for the
                Killer on the High Bridge. Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to

                A teenage mother stays home from school one day with her daughter because she isn't
                feeling well. Just a few hours after her family leaves the house she is brutally
                attacked. Surely it had to be someone she knew. Did they know she would be home that
                day? It is a case that goes cold for nearly two decades before someone unexpected
                comes in and cracks the case wide open. Sources for this episode cannot be listed

            <title>MURDERED: Karina Holmer</title>
            <description>
                In 1996, Boston saw one of the most brutal, and now notorious, murders of their
                city. Over 20 years later, not many people outside of Boston know the name of the
                Swedish nanny who was brutally murdered, dismembered and thrown away with the
                garbage on an early August morning. Karina had secrets and shortly before her death
                she wrote a letter to her friend in Sweden and shared something that would forever
                haunt those who learn about this case. Sources for this episode cannot be listed

                Robert William Fisher is an American fugitive wanted for the murder of his wife and
                two children. Their home in Scottsdale, Arizona was blown up on April 10, 2001, in
                an attempt to cover up the crimes. However, no one has seen or heard from Robert
                since before his family was murdered. Was he the one who killed them? Or could he be
                a victim too? Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character
