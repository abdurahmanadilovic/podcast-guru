                <![CDATA[<p>As Italy, France and Spain entered national lockdowns, Prime Minister Boris Johnson of Britain was still shaking hands with coronavirus patients in hospitals, and then joking about it on national television.

                Background reading: The bizarre dip in oil prices was based on a quirk in the way
                barrels are traded, one that appears only when the market is “undergoing extreme
                stress.”“I’m just living a nightmare,” one leader of a large petroleum association
                said. This is a look inside how the pandemic is decimating the oil industry.

                The New York Times’s reporters working in China have been expelled by the Chinese
                government, alongside reporters covering China for The Wall Street Journal and The
                Washington Post. Today, we speak with one of our correspondents about his experience
                learning that he would have to leave the place he has called home for the last
                decade — and about the last story he reported before he left. Guest: Paul Mozur, the

                more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: China’s announcement of the journalists’ expulsion came weeks
                after President Trump limited the number of Chinese citizens who can work in the
                United States for five state-run Chinese news organizations.While the Chinese
                government’s official statement cited diplomatic tension as the reasoning for the
                expulsion, state media outlets pointed to our critical reporting of China’s mass
                detention of Muslims, government surveillance and its response to the coronavirus
                outbreak in Wuhan as reasons for the move.

            <itunes:summary>Developing a strategy for testing was supposed to be a relatively simple
                part of preparing for the coronavirus in the United States. So what went wrong?
                Guests: Sheri Fink, a correspondent for The Times reporting on global public health,
                and Dr. Helen Y. Chu, an infectious disease expert in Seattle. Dr. Chu was part of a
                research project that tried to conduct early tests for the coronavirus but failed to

                nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: During the early days of the outbreak, when containment would
                have been easier, the federal government missed a series of chances to ensure more
                widespread testing.After weeks of playing down the potential effects of the
                coronavirus, President Trump proposed an emergency relief package to bolster the
                economy — one that has been met by bipartisan opposition.The number of known U.S.
                cases of coronavirus infection has passed 1,000, with the virus found in every
                region of the country. Universities continue to close classrooms. Here are the
                latest updates on the outbreak.

                What started as a story about fear of a new and dangerous virus has become a story
                of fury over the Chinese government’s handling of an epidemic. Today, one of our
                China correspondents takes us behind the scenes of Beijing’s response to a global
                outbreak. Guest: Amy Qin, a China correspondent for The New York Times. For more
                information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: President Xi Jinping faces an accelerating health crisis that is
                also a political one: a profound test of the authoritarian system he has built
                around himself over the past seven years.China’s leader, who rarely mingles with the
                public, visited several sites in Beijing and spoke to medical workers in Wuhan via
                video conferencing.Here are the latest updates on the global outbreak.

                In the trial of Harvey Weinstein, six women have taken the stand, each making
                similar accusations of rape and sexual assault against the movie producer.
                Throughout their testimony, Weinstein’s defense lawyers have portrayed those
                encounters as consensual and suggested that in many cases it was the women who
                wanted something from Mr. Weinstein. His lawyers have seized on the fact that the
                two women whose accounts are at the center of the criminal charges in his New York
                trial agreed to have sex and friendly contact with Mr. Weinstein after they were
                allegedly victimized. Today, one of The Times reporters who broke the story of Mr.
                Weinstein’s alleged abuse more than two years ago speaks with Donna Rotunno, the
                lawyer behind Mr. Weinstein’s legal strategy.

                Guests: Megan Twohey, an investigative reporter for The Times and co-author of “She
                Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement," spoke
                with Donna Rotunno, Harvey Weinstein’s lead defense lawyer. For more information on
                today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: Long before an avalanche of allegations against Mr. Weinstein
                set off a global reckoning over sexual harassment, Ms. Rotunno was steadily building
                a career as a criminal lawyer in Chicago with an unusual specialty: defending men
                accused of sex crimes.Haven’t been following the trial? Here’s what’s happened so
                far.

            <itunes:summary>President Trump was acquitted by the Senate on Wednesday of both
                articles of impeachment. While the vote largely fell along party lines, one senator
                crossed the aisle to vote to convict him. Today, we hear from Senator Mitt Romney
                about that choice.

                Guest: Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, who spoke with Mark Leibovich, the

                Background reading: In a speech before voting to convict, Mr. Romney grew emotional
                as he pronounced the president “guilty of an appalling abuse of public trust.”“I

            <itunes:summary>The media’s coverage of the 2016 presidential campaign has come to be
                criticized for operating under three key assumptions: that Hillary Clinton was
                certain to be the Democratic nominee, that Donald Trump was unlikely to be the
                Republican nominee, and that once Clinton and Trump had become their party’s
                nominees, she would win.

                With voting for 2020 set to begin in Iowa on Monday, “The Daily” sat down with Dean
                Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times, to discuss the lessons he — and
                the organization — learned from 2016. For more information on today’s episode, visit

                Background reading: This is our guide to the 2020 election.We’ve sent reporters to
                every corner of the country and told them not to make any assumptions in this

                to help the country understand itself.As part of a new approach to election
                coverage, The Times’s editorial board has re-examined how — and why — it makes

            <itunes:summary>Three Rust Belt swing states are critical to winning the presidency this
                year — Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. In Pennsylvania, there is one issue
                that could be decisive: fracking natural gas.

                Opposition to fracking could be fatal for a candidate in the state, yet
                front-runners for the Democratic nomination have committed to banning fracking
                nationwide if elected. We went to western Pennsylvania, where fracking affects
                residents daily, to see whether electability in the state could really be reduced to
                this single issue.

                Guests: Shane Goldmacher, a national political reporter for The New York Times,
                traveled to Pennsylvania with Andy Mills and Monika Evstatieva, producers for “The

                Background reading: Our investigative team revealed how immense amounts of methane,
                the primary gas acquired by fracking, are escaping from oil and gas sites

            <itunes:summary>The Obama coalition has become almost mythic within the Democratic Party
                for having united first-time voters, people of color and moderates to win the
                presidency in 2008. This year, Senator Bernie Sanders is betting that he can win
                with the support of young voters and people of color — but without the moderates.

                To do that, he’s counting on winning over and energizing the Latino vote. The
                ultimate test of whether he will be able to do that is in California, where Latinos
                are the single biggest nonwhite voting bloc. While young Latinos in California
                overwhelmingly support Mr. Sanders, to become the Democratic nominee, he will need
                the support of their parents and grandparents as well.

                <![CDATA[<p>At the heart of President Trump’s impeachment is his request that Ukraine investigate how his political rival, former Vice President Joseph R.

                Today, we look at the human and environmental costs of the disaster, its connection
                to climate change and why so many Australians are frustrated by Prime Minister Scott

                Background reading: After Australia’s hottest and driest year on record, Mr.
                Morrison has minimized the connection between the wildfire crisis and climate change
                and declined to make moves to curb the country’s carbon emissions.Many Australians
                entered the new year under apocalyptic blood-red skies as smoke from the fires

                the world. Armageddon is here,” one woman in Canberra said.The fires have burned
                through dozens of towns, destroying at least 3,000 homes. Now, unbridled by
                continuous fire fighting, the blazes have returned to some scorched areas to level
                what is left. Rupert Murdoch controls the largest news company in Australia, and his
                newspapers have contributed to a wave of misinformation about the cause of the
                fires.

                Yesterday on “The Daily,” we heard the story of Lucia Evans, whose allegation of

                York. After Ms. Evans was dropped from the case, questions were raised about how a

            <itunes:summary>Note: This episode contains descriptions of sexual violence.

                The story of Harvey Weinstein is a story of patterns. Scores of women — more than 80
                — have given eerily similar accounts of abuse and harassment by the powerful movie
                mogul.

                This week, two years after those allegations were first reported in The New York
                Times, Mr. Weinstein’s trial opens in New York. In the first part of a two-part
                series, we investigate why the case went from 80 potential plaintiffs to two.

                Guest: Megan Twohey, an investigative reporter for The Times and co-author of “She
                Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped Ignite a Movement.” For more
                information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading:Mr. Weinstein’s reputation preceded him as he stepped into a
                Manhattan courthouse this week to face charges of rape and criminal sexual activity,
                making it difficult to find jurors who did not already have strong opinions about
                the case.The reporters who broke the first investigation into Mr. Weinstein explain
                why the trial rests on a narrow legal case with an already fraught back story and
                why the result is highly unpredictable.On the first day of Mr. Weinstein’s trial,
                two other criminal allegations against him were released in Los Angeles.

                Background reading:Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani was known as the instigator behind
                proxy wars that fueled instability in the Middle East. His death further disturbed
                the region’s delicate power balances — and effectively ended a landmark nuclear

            <itunes:summary>To mention the Mueller report in articles of impeachment against
                President Trump, or not? That’s the question Democrats have been asking. Today’s
                impeachment hearing before the House Judiciary Committee gave us a clue about which
                way they’re leaning.

                “The Latest” is a series on the impeachment inquiry, from the team behind “The
                Daily.” You can find more information about it here.

            <itunes:summary>A last-minute booking, a furtive cab ride and a spy in the window. For
                the past year, Paul Mozur has been investigating the story of a son determined to
                free his mother from a repressive system of detention and surveillance in western
                China. In doing so, he found a crack in China’s surveillance state — and a mother on
                her deathbed in Xinjiang.

                Today, we hear from the man’s mother for the first time.

                Guest: Paul Mozur, a technology reporter for The New York Times based in Shanghai,
                spoke with Ferkat Jawdat, a Uighur who is an American citizen and lives in Virginia,
                and his mother in Xinjiang, China. For more information on today’s episode, visit
                nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading:The Chinese authorities are using a vast secret system of facial
                recognition technology to control the Uighurs, a largely Muslim minority in western
                China. The government may also be taking citizens’ DNA without consent to enhance
                the system.“We must be as harsh as them, and show absolutely no mercy.” Leaked
                documents reveal how the Chinese authorities orchestrated the crackdown on one
                million or more ethnic Uighurs.If you missed our previous interviews with Mr.
                Jawdat, here are Part 1 and Part 2.

                extrajudicial killings, Iran pointed to the rebuke as evidence that the

                In Chapter 1, we hear of a woman who appeared on the platform of the New Delhi
                railway station with her two adult children, declaring they were the descendants of

            <itunes:summary>Free-market economists once talked about “the miracle of Chile,”
                praising its policies as Latin America’s great economic success story. But recently,
                over a million people have flipped the script, taking to the streets and facing down
                a violent police response as they demand a reckoning on the promise of prosperity
                that never came.

                Today, we explore how, in Chile, capitalism itself is now on trial.

                Guest: Amanda Taub, who explores the ideas and context behind major world events as
                a columnist for The Interpreter at The New York Times, spoke with Annie Brown, a
                producer for “The Daily.” For more information on today’s episode, visit
                nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: “It’s not 30 pesos, it’s 30 years.” Our correspondent went to
                Santiago, the Chilean capital, to understand how a small hike in public
                transportation fares ignited mass protests.After weeks of demonstrations, Chile’s
                president said he would support a new Constitution. But for many, it was too little,
                too late.Our correspondent went inside a trauma unit in Chile that’s responding to
                “an epidemic” of protesters who have been shot in the eye by police pellet guns.

            <itunes:summary>The House of Representatives opened historic impeachment hearings on
                Wednesday, with William B. Taylor Jr. and George P. Kent, senior career civil
                servants, caught in the crossfire. Democrats underscored the constitutional import
                of the proceedings, while Republicans branded the whole investigation into President
                Trump’s dealings with Ukraine a sham. Mr. Taylor and Mr. Kent — carefully, if
                cinematically — detailed the emergence of a shadow foreign policy, one which had the
                capacity to determine the fate of an ally in the face of Russian aggression.

                We discuss what this phase of the impeachment inquiry could mean for the president —
                and for the 2020 election.

                Guest: Michael S. Schmidt, who covers national security and federal investigations
                for The New York Times. For more information on today’s episode, visit

                Background reading: Mr. Taylor said that, in a call with Gordon D. Sondland, the
                American ambassador to the European Union, President Trump had made clear he cared
                “more about the investigations of Biden” than Ukraine’s security.Here are key

                Now Mr. Sondland, a blunt-spoken hotelier, has changed tack. In a new four-page
                sworn statement released by the House, he confirmed his role in communicating

            <itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType>
            <itunes:summary>In 2013, Aimee Stephens watched her boss read a carefully worded letter.

                “I have felt imprisoned in a body that does not match my mind. And this has caused
                me great despair and loneliness,” she had written. “With the support of my loving
                wife, I have decided to become the person that my mind already is.”

                Ms. Stephens was fired after coming out as transgender. Now, she is the lead
                plaintiff in a Supreme Court case that will determine the employment rights of gay
                and transgender workers across the nation.

                Guests: Adam Liptak, who covers the Supreme Court for The New York Times, and Aimee
                Stephens, the lead plaintiff in the transgender discrimination case heard by the
                Supreme Court. For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: The forthcoming Supreme Court ruling hangs on justices’
                interpretation of wording in the Civil Rights Act that prohibits employment
                discrimination “because of sex.”The case came to the Supreme Court from a federal
                appeals court, which found in favor of Ms. Stephens last year.

            <itunes:summary>The New York Times and Siena College conducted a major new poll,
                tackling the biggest questions about the 2020 presidential race: How likely is
                President Trump to be re-elected and which Democrat is best positioned to defeat
                him?

                The results reveal that the president remains highly competitive in the battleground
                states likeliest to decide his re-election, with Democratic candidates struggling to
                win back the support of white working-class voters who backed Mr. Trump in 2016.

                The poll also presents a snapshot of how the top Democratic candidates might fare in
                the general election — a critical question for Democratic voters hoping to take back
                the White House.

            <itunes:summary>In just three months, the first election of the Democratic presidential
                race will be held in Iowa.

                Over the weekend, the party held its most important political event yet in the
                prelude to that vote — including a fabled annual dinner attended by almost every
                remaining candidate in the campaign. At this dinner in 2007, Barack Obama, then a
                senator, delivered a searing critique of Hillary Clinton’s electability, helping him
                pull ahead in the polls. Candidates this time around were hoping for a similar
                campaign-defining moment.

                We traveled to Des Moines to find out how the candidates are trying to stand out in
                a crowded field and to try to discern who might have the political support,
                financial might and organizational prowess to become the nominee.

                Guest: Reid J. Epstein, a campaigns and elections reporter for The Times based in
                Washington D.C.

                Clare Toeniskoetter and Monika Evstatieva, producers for “The Daily,” who traveled
                to Des Moines to speak with campaign supporters.

                Background reading: With the Iowa caucuses fast approaching, the ideological debate
                has remained the same, but the key players have shifted, with Mayor Pete Buttigieg
                and Senator Elizabeth Warren appearing to have gained momentum. The latest poll in
                Iowa suggested that Ms. Warren had seized much of Bernie Sanders’s youthful

            <itunes:summary>The House of Representatives voted to begin the next phase of the
                impeachment inquiry into President Trump — one which will be open to public
                scrutiny. Two Democrats in the House broke ranks and voted against the resolution,
                which outlined rules for the impeachment process. That was the only complication to

                Background reading: House Democrats decided they now have enough confidence in the
                severity of the underlying facts about Mr. Trump’s dealings with Ukraine to open the
                inquiry to the public, despite the risk that doing so would further polarize the
                electorate. This is a timeline of the events that prompted the impeachment
                inquiry.Here’s how Democrats and Republicans voted on the impeachment rules

William B. Taylor Jr., a career diplomat who has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, prepared a 15-page opening statement for investigators on Tuesday. He described his testimony as “a rancorous story about whistle-blowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption and interference in elections.” In his statement, Mr. Taylor documented two divergent channels of United States policymaking in Ukraine, “one regular and one highly irregular.” He said Mr. Trump had used the shadow channel to make America’s relationship with Ukraine — including a $391 million aid package — conditional on its government’s willingness to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his family. The question of a quid pro quo for the military aid has been pursued by House Democrats since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry.

                <![CDATA[<p>The Democrats leading the impeachment inquiry are calling testimony from the acting envoy to Ukraine the “most damning” yet, implicating President Trump himself in a quid pro quo over military aid to the country. William B. Taylor Jr., a career diplomat who has served under both Democratic and Republican administrations, prepared a 15-page opening statement for investigators on Tuesday. He described his testimony as “a rancorous story about whistle-blowers, Mr. Giuliani, side channels, quid pro quos, corruption and interference in elections.” In his statement, Mr. Taylor documented two divergent channels of United States policymaking in Ukraine, “one regular and one highly irregular.” He said Mr. Trump had used the shadow channel to make America’s relationship with Ukraine — including a $391 million aid package — conditional on its government’s willingness to investigate one of his political rivals, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and his family. The question of a quid pro quo for the military aid has been pursued by House Democrats since the beginning of the impeachment inquiry. In Mr. Taylor, investigators have a former ambassador testifying under oath that the allegations are true. </p><p>Guest: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/nicholas-fandos?smid=pc-thedaily" target="_blank">Nicholas Fandos</a>, who covers Congress for The New York Times.

            <itunes:summary>Yesterday on “The Daily,” we met Kamalle Dabboussy, who said his
                daughter had been tricked by her husband into joining the Islamic State. His
                daughter and three grandchildren are being held in a Syrian detention camp for the
                relatives of ISIS fighters.

                When we left off, Mr. Dabboussy had just received a call from a journalist that
                suggested his family’s situation was about to become far more precarious. President
                Trump had announced that he would withdraw U.S. troops from the Syrian border, and
                Kurdish forces who had been guarding the prisons were expected to abandon their
                posts, leaving the detainees’ lives in imminent danger.

                Today, we follow Mr. Dabboussy’s struggle to convince the Australian government that
                his daughter and her children are worth saving — despite their ties to the Islamic
                State.

                Guest: Livia Albeck-Ripka, a reporter for The Times in Melbourne, Australia, spoke
                with Kamalle Dabboussy, whose daughter Mariam is trapped in Syria with her children.

                Background coverage: Here’s the first episode in this two-part series, in which we
                introduced Kamalle Dabboussy and his fight to bring his family home from a war
                zone.Mr. Dabboussy is one of a cohort of parents in Australia lobbying the
                government to help release their loved ones from detention camps in northern Syria.

            <title>A Foreseen Calamity in Syria</title>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[<p>The presence of U.S. troops in northern Syria was designed to protect America’s allies and keep its enemies there in check. President Trump’s unilateral withdrawal from the region quickly, and predictably, unraveled a tenuous peace on the volatile border between Syria and Turkey. His decision handed a gift to four American adversaries: Iran, Russia, the Syrian government and the Islamic State. David E.

                the volatile border between Syria and Turkey. His decision handed a gift to four
                American adversaries: Iran, Russia, the Syrian government and the Islamic State.

            <itunes:summary>This week, we’re producing episodes of “The Daily” from The New York
                Times’s Washington bureau.

                The impeachment inquiry is entering a pivotal phase as Congress returns from recess.
                The White House’s strategy to block the investigation is beginning to crumble, with
                five administration officials set to testify before House investigators.

                On Monday, those committees heard testimony about why the president removed the
                longtime ambassador, Marie L. Yovanovitch, just two months before the call in which
                he asked the Ukrainian president for a favor. Today, we look at how Ms. Yovanovitch
                ended up at the center of the impeachment process.

                Guests: Sharon LaFraniere, an investigative reporter based in Washington, and Rachel
                Quester and Clare Toeniskoetter, producers for “The Daily.” For more information on
                today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background coverage: Marie L. Yovanovitch told House investigators that she was
                removed from office on the basis of “false claims by people with clearly
                questionable motives.” The effort to pressure Ukraine so alarmed John Bolton, then
                the national security adviser, that he told an aide to alert White House lawyers.
                “Giuliani’s a hand grenade who’s going to blow everybody up,” an aide quoted him as
                saying of President Trump’s personal lawyer.

            <itunes:summary>Today on “The Daily,” we present Episode 5, Part 2 of “1619,” a New York
                Times audio series hosted by Nikole Hannah-Jones. You can find more information
                about it at nytimes.com/1619podcast.

                The Provosts, a family of sugar-cane farmers in Louisiana, had worked the same land
                for generations. When it became harder and harder to keep hold of that land, June
                Provost and his wife, Angie, didn’t know why — and then a phone call changed their
                understanding of everything. In the finale of “1619,” we hear the rest of June and
                Angie’s story, and its echoes in a past case that led to the largest civil rights
                settlement in American history.

                Guests: June and Angie Provost; Adizah Eghan and Annie Brown, producers for “1619”;
                and Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of history, race and public policy at
                Harvard University and the author of “The Condemnation of Blackness.”

                Background reading:“The number of black sugar-cane farmers in Louisiana is most
                likely in the single digits,” Khalil Gibran Muhammad writes in his essay on the
                history of the American sugar industry. “They are the exceedingly rare exceptions to
                a system designed to codify black loss.”The “1619” audio series is part of The 1619
                Project, a major initiative from The Times observing the 400th anniversary of the
                beginning of American slavery. Read more from the project here.

                information about two feminist icons — Gloria Allred and her daughter, Lisa Bloom —
                that raises questions about their legacies and the legal system in which they’ve
                worked. Today, we look at the role of Ms. Bloom, a lawyer who represented Mr.
                Weinstein.

                Guests: Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey, investigative reporters for The New York Times
                and the authors of “She Said: Breaking the Sexual Harassment Story That Helped
                Ignite a Movement.” For more information on today’s episode, visit
                nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: New reporting in “She Said” shows how some figures who have
                presented themselves as allies of victims have helped maintain their silence — and,
                in some cases, profited from it.Read more about Ms. Bloom’s involvement in the
                Weinstein case.

            <itunes:summary>Four hundred years ago, in August 1619, a ship carrying more than 20
                enslaved Africans arrived in the English colony of Virginia. No aspect of the
                country that would be formed here has been untouched by the 250 years of slavery
                that followed.

                “1619,” a New York Times audio series, examines the long shadow of that fateful
                moment. Today, instead of our usual show, we present Episode 1: “The Fight for a
                True Democracy.”

                Background reading:“Without the idealistic, strenuous and patriotic efforts of black
                Americans, our democracy today would most likely look very different — it might not
                be a democracy at all,” Nikole Hannah-Jones writes.The “1619” audio series is part
                of The 1619 Project, a major initiative from The Times observing the 400th
                anniversary of the beginning of American slavery. Read more from the project here.

                unrest is exposing the inherent conflict in Hong Kong’s political system since China
                reclaimed the territory from Britain in 1997: an effort to unite Beijing’s
                authoritarianism with civil liberties.Here’s a guide to what prompted the Hong Kong
                protests, and a look at how they have evolved.

                others. We spoke with our colleague about what happened in a similar case against
                Mr. Epstein over a decade ago. Guest: Patricia Mazzei, the Miami bureau chief for
                The New York Times. For more information on today’s episode, visit
                nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: The new indictment of Mr. Epstein could prompt a reckoning for
                the Justice Department, which is facing fresh scrutiny over a plea deal in 2008 that
                protected him from federal charges.Alexander Acosta, President Trump’s labor
                secretary and the former United States attorney in the Southern District of Florida,
                was personally involved in negotiating that plea deal.

            <itunes:summary>With asylum requests at a record high, the Trump administration is
                telling migrants to wait in Mexico. We look at how that policy could fundamentally
                change immigration in the United States. Guests: Natalie Kitroeff, a business
                reporter for The New York Times, spoke with Zolan Kanno-Youngs, who covers homeland
                security. For more information on today’s episode, visit nytimes.com/thedaily.

                Background reading: A recent State Department report acknowledged the possibility
                that migrants from Central America were no safer in Mexico than at home from the
                gangs that had threatened them.The cornerstone of President Trump’s deal to avert
                tariffs with Mexico — the terms of which were largely already agreed-upon in
                December — was an expansion of the “Remain in Mexico” program.

                Background reading:People involved in the investigation say the N.S.A. tool,
                EternalBlue, was found in Baltimore’s network by four contractors hired to restore
                computer services. The N.S.A. says that’s not the case. Cybercriminals have been
                targeting other vulnerable American towns and cities, from Pennsylvania to Texas, in
                ways that could disrupt local governments for months.

                populist whose nationalist message has often pitted Hindus against Muslims. We look
                at what Mr. Modi’s likely re-election this week tells us about the country’s

                Background reading: Mr. Modi’s Hindu nationalist politics and his efforts to project
                a strong image of India abroad appeared to have played well among the country’s 900
                million registered voters, according to exit polls.The results of the election may
                reveal not just a decision on Mr. Modi but also a deeper one on what kind of
                government India really wants.

                after six weeks of pregnancy, and others, including Missouri, are expected to follow
                suit. Some Missourians are crossing the state line to Illinois, where abortion
                access is protected. We spent a day at a clinic in Illinois with three women who

                This episode includes disturbing language.

                Background coverage:Bans on abortion in the very early weeks of pregnancy — after a
                fetal heartbeat is detected — used to be rare. But in the past three months, four
                states have passed so-called heartbeat bills, and 11 others are considering them. In
                1973, the Supreme Court ruled — with little controversy — that women had a
                constitutional right to abortion. How did the decision give way to today’s deep
                political divide? Listen to a series from “The Daily” on Roe v. Wade.
