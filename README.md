# Podcast Guru

## Background

This is an example project built for a series of blog posts I have written on my [personal blog](https://www.codingstoic.com/index.php/2020/01/20/building-a-podcast-app-series-1-mini-in-app-player/) and on [dev.to](https://dev.to/abdurahmanadilovic/building-a-podcast-app-series-1-mini-in-app-player-7k0) under the title "**How to build 
a podcast app in Kotlin using ExoPlayer**". 

## Architecture

This app is using dependency injection, repository pattern and jetpack components to showcase some of the most recommended patterns for building Android apps.

## Contributing

Feel free to colabore with me on the app's source code!
